# FezaMarket Database Quick Start Guide

This guide provides the essential steps to set up the complete MariaDB database for the FezaMarket e-commerce platform.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have MariaDB/MySQL running
sudo systemctl status mariadb

# Install PHP dependencies if needed
composer install
```

### 2. Database Setup
```sql
-- Connect to MariaDB as root
mysql -u root -p

-- Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ecommerce_platform CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'ecommerce_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SecurePassword123!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ecommerce_platform.* TO 'ecommerce_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### 3. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit database credentials
nano .env
```

Update these lines in `.env`:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=ecommerce_platform
DB_USER=ecommerce_user
DB_PASS=SecurePassword123!
```

### 4. Run Complete Setup
```bash
# Fresh installation with all tables and sample data
php scripts/migrate.php --fresh --seed
```

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check everything is working
php scripts/verify_schema.php --verbose
```

## üìä What Gets Created

### Database Tables (38 total)
- **Core**: users, categories, vendors, products, addresses
- **Shopping**: cart, orders, order_items, payments, transactions
- **Social**: reviews, wishlists, recommendations, user_follows
- **Live Shopping**: live_streams, chat_messages, stream_viewers
- **Security**: sessions, security_logs, email_tokens, notifications
- **Admin**: system_settings, admin_logs, api_keys, file_uploads

### Sample Data Includes
- Admin user (admin@fezalogistics.com / password123)
- Test customers and vendors
- 8 sample products (electronics)
- Product categories and reviews
- System settings and notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Run pending migrations only
php scripts/migrate.php

# Fresh install (drops all tables)
php scripts/migrate.php --fresh

# Fresh install with sample data
php scripts/migrate.php --fresh --seed

# Check migration status
php scripts/migrate.php --status

# Rollback last batch
php scripts/migrate.php --rollback
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Basic schema verification
php scripts/verify_schema.php

# Detailed verification with report
php scripts/verify_schema.php --verbose --report

# Auto-fix missing indexes
php scripts/verify_schema.php --fix
```

## üîç Testing Your Setup

### 1. Database Connection Test
```php
<?php
require_once 'includes/db.php';
try {
    $pdo = db();
    echo "‚úÖ Database connection successful!\n";
    
    // Test a simple query
    $stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users");
    $result = $stmt->fetch();
    echo "‚úÖ Found {$result['count']} users in database\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "‚ùå Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
}
?>
```

### 2. Web Interface Test
Access your application in a web browser:
- Homepage should display sample products
- Login with: admin@fezalogistics.com / password123
- All features should work without SQL errors

### 3. Feature Verification
- ‚úÖ Product browsing and search
- ‚úÖ User registration and login  
- ‚úÖ Shopping cart functionality
- ‚úÖ Order processing
- ‚úÖ Product reviews and ratings
- ‚úÖ Wishlist management
- ‚úÖ Live shopping features
- ‚úÖ Admin panel access
- ‚úÖ Vendor management
- ‚úÖ Notification system

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Check MariaDB is running
sudo systemctl status mariadb

# Check user permissions
mysql -u ecommerce_user -p -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();"
```

### Migration Failures
```bash
# Check what failed
php scripts/migrate.php --status

# Start fresh if needed
php scripts/migrate.php --fresh --seed
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check for missing indexes
php scripts/verify_schema.php --verbose

# Apply recommended fixes
php scripts/verify_schema.php --fix
```
