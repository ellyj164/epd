# Email System Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the email registration issue in the EPD repository where users were receiving the error message "An error occurred during registration. Please try again." and no verification emails were being sent.

## Root Cause Analysis
The EPD repository was using a complex EmailService class with HTML email templates that was not functioning properly. The reference repository (`ellyj164/ref`) had a simple, working email implementation using PHP's `mail()` function with plain text emails and OTP verification.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the complex email system with the simple, working approach from the reference repository while maintaining the EPD's existing structure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. User Registration (`includes/models.php`)
- Updated `User::register()` method to generate 8-digit OTP codes
- Store OTP in existing `email_tokens` table
- Send verification email using simple `mail()` function
- Redirect to OTP verification page instead of showing success message

### 2. Email Verification (`verify-email.php`)
- Complete rewrite to handle OTP verification instead of token links
- Clean verification form matching reference repository style
- Validates OTP against database and marks user as verified

### 3. Registration Flow (`register.php`)
- Updated to redirect to `verify-email.php?email=user@example.com` upon successful registration
- Matches the exact flow from the reference repository

### 4. Resend Verification (`resend-verification.php`)
- Updated to generate and send new OTP codes
- Clears old tokens and creates new ones
- Redirects to verification page

### 5. Password Reset (`forgot-password.php` & `reset-password.php`)
- Updated forgot password to use simple email approach
- Updated reset password to use `email_tokens` table
- Matches reference implementation behavior

### 6. All Email Functions (`includes/email.php`)
- Updated all email helper functions to use simple `mail()` approach
- Consistent plain text email format
- Proper error handling and logging
